# A practical guide surviving to AWS SAM

In this series I wanna explain how to survive to [AWS SAM](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model).
AWS SAM is an open-source framework that you can use to build serverless applications on AWS. Opposed to other tools like 
serverless framework it's an official AWS product making it valuable to give it a try.

If you are new to the serverless world you may feel overwhelmed by definitions, tools, best practices... but don't worry once you started 
playing with it you will not be able to stop.

But I don't want to dwell on other details so let's start.
